/**
 * Pure folder-list logic for per-workspace multi-root folders.
 *
 * DSH core gives a workspace exactly ONE canonical directory
 * (`WorkspaceView.path`). This module layers a plugin-owned list of EXTRA
 * folders on top of it, plus one designated root folder per workspace:
 *
 *   - the canonical directory is always folder #0 (the "base"); it cannot be
 *     removed and may be the root;
 *   - `root` is stored only when it names an EXTRA folder — "base is the root"
 *     is expressed by omitting the key, so the base path is never duplicated
 *     into the sidecar;
 *   - a session whose recorded `cwd` lives inside an extra folder belongs to
 *     that folder, not to the project row.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and platform-agnostic: it imports no React, no DOM
 * and no cordis so plain Node (the verifier, the host route) can load it.
